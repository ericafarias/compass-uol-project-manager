# Compass.uol: Project-Manager
The **Project Manager** aims to organize and manage tasks, following the same logic as the **Kanban** agile methodology.

## Technologies Used

The platform was developed using the following technologies:

- **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language): For structuring the application.
- **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets): For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To add dynamics to the application.

## Features

Currently, the project only includes the **creation of the main screens** of the application, without fully implemented functionality.
